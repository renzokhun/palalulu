          Hey there, fellow anime lovers! As a self-proclaimed anime aficionado, I make it a point to keep up with the latest shows that catch my interest. So, I thought I'd jot them down here (this is really only to document what I’ve watched every season that stood out to me) and share them with you. Let's dive right in without any unnecessary fluff!<br /><br />

         1. <span><b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion This Wonderful World!</b></span><br /><br />

          As a die-hard fan of KONOSUBA, I was beyond thrilled when I heard about this spin-off/prequel series. It delves into the life of Megumin, my all-time favorite character from the series. Although it doesn't feature the whole adventuring party that we know, the humor that made the main series so enjoyable remains intact. It's an absolute delight to see the Crimson Demon Village and its eccentric inhabitants come to life. For those who have continued the story in the light novel after watching the main series, then you’ll know that some of these “eccentric inhabitants” make appearances later in the story. If you're a dedicated KONOSUBA fan like me, this is definitely a must-watch! Fingers crossed for a Season 4 announcement soon!<br /><br />

          2. <span><b>Hell’s Paradise</b></span><br /><br />

          Back in late 2020, before the pandemic hit, I delved into the manga of this series along with Jujutsu Kaisen and Chainsaw Man, eagerly anticipating their anime adaptations. Now, seeing all three of them come to life as anime is truly amazing. It's even more exciting to note that all three shows are brought to us by the same studio, MAPPA. Hell’s Paradise stands out as a captivating action anime with well-developed characters, an engaging storyline, and stunning animation. It's a must-watch for fans of the genre.<br /><br />

          3. <span><b>The Legendary Hero is Dead!</b></span><br /><br />

          Three words: dumb, funny, and thighs. This show revolves around an obnoxious villager who accidentally kills the legendary hero, leading to an unexpected twist. If you're open to watching a parodic and trashy ecchi anime, then give this thigh-rific (sorry) series a shot. It's worth noting that the manga has already concluded, so if you find yourself craving more content after the anime, you know where to turn.<br /><br /> 

          4. <span><b>Oshi no Ko</b></span><br /><br />

          This anime exceeded my expectations, quickly skyrocketing to become one of the most popular shows of the season. The premise is rather straightforward—a revenge story intertwined with elements of drama and suspense. The overall tone of the show leans towards darkness, occasionally punctuated by moments of humor. The characters themselves are intriguing, each with their own unique motivations and complexities. Additionally, the animation quality is undeniably top-notch, adding a visually stunning layer to the viewing experience. Let's not forget to mention the anime themes, which are absolute bangers, further enhancing the overall appeal. If you're in the mood for a captivating and well-crafted anime, this is undoubtedly one to add to your watchlist.<br /><br />

          5. <span><b>My Love Story with Yamada-kun at Lv999</b></span><br /><br />

          As one of the few shoujo mangas I genuinely enjoyed, this anime adaptation presents a delightful and lighthearted story. It follows a girl who begins playing online games due to her boyfriend's influence, only to be left heartbroken when he finds someone else in the game. Enter Yamada, a fellow gamer who becomes a significant presence in her life. From this point on, the story continues into a romcom. In many ways, the story resembles the beloved series Horimiya. It balances humor, slice-of-life vibes, and universal appeal. The animation quality and amusing chibi animations enhance the overall experience.<br /><br />

          6. <span><b>Dangers in my Heart</b></span><br /><br />

          If you enjoyed watching Komi Can't Communicate or Kubo Won't Let Me Be Invisible, then this series will be right up your alley. It exudes similar vibes. Having caught up with the manga, I can confidently say that this is a series worth sticking around for. Although it may not focus heavily on romance or possess a deeper storyline, it offers a chill and heartwarming watch that brings a smile to your face. Stick around for a light-hearted and enjoyable experience.<br /><br />

          7. <span><b>Insomniacs after School</b></span><br /><br />

          For wholesome content that unfolds naturally, this show is a perfect choice. Its realistic and relatable depiction of character interactions creates an enjoyable slice-of-life experience. The gradual opening up of the main characters evokes a warm and fuzzy feeling, emphasizing the importance of support in life's challenges. If you're seeking a story that will touch your heart and offer a comforting escape, I highly recommend giving this anime a chance.<br /><br />

          8. <span><b>Skip and Loafer</b></span><br /><br />

          At first, I had doubts about watching this anime because the synopsis and cover didn't capture my interest. However, I decided to give it a chance, and boy, was I mistaken. Right from the first episode, I was completely hooked on to the series. What truly stood out to me was the authentic portrayal of each character, which, in my opinion, is the essence of a great slice of life anime. They all possess their own flaws, secrets, and layers, making them feel incredibly genuine. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that the characters actually behave like real high school students. I'm eagerly looking forward to jumping straight to the manga once the show finishes airing.<br /><br />

          9. <span><b>A Galaxy Next Door</b></span><br /><br />

          Even though this is just a typical romance anime with a touch of fantasy and very fast-paced romance compared to others, it stands out as a wonderful adaptation. The story itself isn't overly heavy, making it a perfect choice for a chill and enjoyable viewing experience. Even without overexaggerated comedy animations, the show is still entertaining to watch.<br /><br />

          10. <span><b>Blue Orchestra</b></span><br /><br />

          I've been reading the manga of this particular series for a while now. Finally, there's an anime adaptation of the series. The manga didn't gain much popularity, resulting in a scarcity of translators. Usually, only one chapter gets translated each year. Hopefully, this situation changes soon because of the anime. The story, unfortunately accompanied by clunky CGI at times, beautifully combines slice of life and drama elements. It explores the musical elements of the orchestra beyond just focusing on the main character's violin skills.<br /><br />

          So, these are the anime series I'm currently following this season. You may wonder why I'm not watching other shows like the new season of Demon Slayer, Dr. Stone, Mashle, and others. It honestly simply comes down to personal preference and the question of whether watching the animated adaptation is necessary after reading the manga. Keep in mind that everything I've shared here is purely my personal opinion and not an objective view. Ultimately, I encourage you to watch the anime that genuinely interests you. Ciao!<br />
